### Code files guide

`inject.ino` file is the main one controlling the arduino, which itself can be "controlled" through `stepper.py` on the terminal

`sigmoid_analysis.py` is a super simple way of analysing ideal fluorescence curves - obviously will be harder than this but this is to give an idea


Example CAD files for the microfluidics, as well as the syringe pump `.stl` files, can be found on the drive.

May need to add XML files for controlling EVOS (if it can do this)

Also real-time imaging and/or some way of reducing data size without info loss might be good
