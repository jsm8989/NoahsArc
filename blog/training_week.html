						<p style="color:cyan;font-size:1.15em;"><b>Section 1: General overview</b></p>

						<p style="text-align:justify">Earlier this month, our team completed the
	Gravity-Related Experiments Training Week (GRETW) provided by ESA as part
	of our preparation for the Spin Your Thesis! campaign coming up this
	September. We will be using this blog post to recount some of the
	week&#39;s experiences that we found the most useful and interesting!
	Science communication, although often overlooked, is an essential factor
	to informing, involving and inspiring people through STEM. We will be
	publishing more longform content in the coming months, and hope that
	you enjoy reading these alongside following our shorter updates over on
	Instagram and Twitter (both @teamnoahsarc).</p>

						<br>
						<p style="color:cyan;font-size:1.15em;"><b>Section 2: A Brief History of Gravity,
	and Astronaut Tales</b></p>
						<p>Alongside our project workshops and team
	sessions, we attended two inspirational lectures: A Brief History of
	Gravity, by Professor Hendry, an astrophysicist at the University of
	Glasgow; and Tales from an Astronaut, by Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Clervoy.</p>
						<p>They were so full of interesting content
	that we have decided to dedicate a separate blog post to these. So stay
	tuned!</p>

						<br>
						<p style="color:cyan;font-size:1.15em;"><b>Section 3: What actually is Systems
	Engineering? Why do we require requirements?</b></p>
						<p>Another great aspect of the training
	week was the level of interaction built into the lectures and activities,
	such as the Systems Engineering workshop. Delivered by Alex Kinnaird,
	Engineering Coordinator at the ESA Education Office, we were given a
	comprehensive overview of what systems engineering actually is, and
	how it is applied within the space industry.</p>
						<p>Systems engineering is formally defined as an interdisciplinary field that
	deals with the design, integration and management of complex systems
	over their entire life cycle. Or, as Alex explained it - a bunch of
	things, which do a thing, which come together to do a specific thing
	(within a set boundary and a set time). The term &lsquo;systems
	engineering&rsquo; has existed since the early 1900s, and its concepts
	were actually applied to major events such as World War II (see a more
	modern example below). This is often a surprising discovery for many,
	since the topic has only gained industry-wide traction and popularity
	in recent decades, spearheaded by milestones such as NASA&rsquo;s
	publication of its Systems Engineering Handbook in 1995. </p>

						</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>A &lsquo;system&rsquo; that needs to be
	&lsquo;engineered&rsquo; can be anything that involves multiple components
	(hardware, software, services or users), and connections between the same.
	For example, a city&rsquo;s subway network is a system that includes the
	trains, passengers, route scheduling methods, ticketing systems, etc.
	These systems can also be examined at different levels of granularity,
	e.g. power transmission and door operation mechanisms are subsystems of
	a train, while turnstile design and available purchase methods can be
	subsystems of a ticketing process. One example of a relationship that
	connects all these listed components is the calculation of delays per
	unit time - older engines, complicated turnstiles and unautomated ticket
	purchasing can all increase the likelihood of delayed journeys, especially
	if the travel demand is high. Similarly, most space-domain technologies and
	missions are highly complex systems with many moving parts, which need
	to be engineered to work together effectively. This is where requirement
	writing and analysis comes in. Every subsystem and component is
	&lsquo;required&rsquo; to fulfil certain functions, in order for their
	encompassing system to meet its overarching requirement or purpose (this
	is usually derived from project goals or user needs).</p>

	<br>


						<p>Each &lsquo;Your Thesis!&rsquo; project has a
	requirement of successfully conducting their experiment, within the
	given temporal and financial boundaries. The main system within our
	project is the experiment itself, where the microscope and microfluidic
	chip setup will be located (see above). This interfaces with other systems
	such as the LDC platform/personnel, and the experiment control center.
	Formal, customized requirements need to be written for our experiment
	and assigned under various categories such as functional, performance
	and design. </p>
						<p>Our learnings from this workshop were
						centered on writing good requirements, which we have been using in
						experimental documents that need to be completed before September&rsquo;s
						campaign. Here are some examples of the requirements we have written so
						far:</p>
						<ol>
							<li style="color:white;font-size:0.85em;text-align:left">
							This experiment shall assess
							the influence of hypergravity on the passive glucose absorption
							process in cellular systems (functional)</li><br>
							<li style="color:white;font-size:0.85em;text-align:left">All experimental equipment in
							use shall be under the maximum mass of 800kg (LDC gondola capacity)
							on final setup (design)</li><br>
							<li style="color:white;font-size:0.85em;text-align:left">The fluid management
							system, including pumps, shall be powered using the LDC gondola&rsquo;s
							existing power supply (interface)</li>
						</ol>

						<p>This step is crucial since it enables
	us to &lsquo;verify&rsquo; these requirements throughout our
	experiment&rsquo;s lifecycle, i.e. check whether or not our
	developed system is meeting the established requirements. This is one of
	the ways that we can make our best effort to ensure success of the project.</p>

						<br>
						<p style="color:cyan;font-size:1.15em;"><b>Section 4: Speaking to the experts and
	solidifying our experiment</b></p>
						<p>A significant part of this training week
	was made up of teamwork sessions on our projects, including the opportunity
	to quiz the experts from our respective facilities. We found this
	particularly valuable as it allowed us to clear up any technical
	questions we had about the Large Diameter Centrifuge, the dos and
	don&rsquo;ts of running our experiment in it, and what type of biscuits
	we should bring the technicians. It is crucial to know the exact technical
	specifications and running parameters of any equipment we use, so that we
	can plan accordingly and (hopefully) minimise any risk of a failed
	experiment. Especially since our experiment day is the first time we
	will actually be using the LDC equipment! It also allowed us to listen to
	the questions of other Your Thesis! Teams, which brought up ideas we had
	not thought of, and discussions which were mutually beneficial to us all.
	By the end of the expert consultations, we left with a more solid plan,
	and a rather large shopping list of cables and components to purchase.</p>
						<p>The importance of running multiple test experiments
	was driven home during these sessions. Even though we obviously cannot
	run pre-campaign tests in a hypergravity environment, we will be conducting
	the experiment itself in a lab environment and refining the procedure -
	in fact, Jamie will soon be practising some of
	the techniques in his home lab, &nbsp;so that we can optimise
	our 2.5 days at the LDC. A combination of our learnings from this training
	week, and our knowledge from reading the LDC&rsquo;s technical manual
	will enable us to prepare effectively for
	our campaign and pinpoint any other questions we may have for the relevant
	experts.</p>

						<br>
						<p style="color:cyan;font-size:1.15em;"><b>Section 5: Meet the other teams!</b></p>
						<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t just us on this course!
	We got to meet the other teams taking part in the Your Thesis! programmes
	and learn about the wide variety of experiments that they will soon drop,
	fly, and spin in the name of science. We have included their Meet the Team
	pages below as published by ESA, and highly encourage you to check them out.</p>
