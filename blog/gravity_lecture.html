						<h1>What is gravity?</h1>
						<span>March 8, 2021</span>
            <p>
            “I don’t even understand the equations as well as I should” - Prof Hendry, on the equations describing the Standard Model of particle physics, which has been one of the most successful physics theories to date. But one thing it doesn’t do so well? Gravity.

---

Gravity is one of four fundamental forces of nature, alongside the electromagnetic, strong and weak interactions. I know what you’re thinking - what about friction? Thrust? The mental force required to put the ice cream away before it’s all gone? Well, all of those (apart from the psychological ones, which we will not consider as a force here) are actually electromagnetism, occurring as a result of reactions between tiny charged particles which add together to give the overall forces we see and feel in everyday life. These phenomena are extremely well described. What about gravity?

To understand how gravity works, we need to go back a few hundred years and look at the experiments performed by Galileo. He was revolutionary for science in many ways, simply by making the decision not to simply accept the status quo. He showed that the commonly held Aristotelian views of the day were wrong; for example, in the absence of air resistance, a hammer and a feather should fall down at the same rate. This was most notably confirmed by astronaut David Scott on the moon, as part of Apollo 15 (embed this). 

After Galileo, came someone called Isaac Newton, who you may have heard of. He decided to try and explain physical observations using mathematics; one of the famous results of this is his Universal Law of Gravitation, which still has a remarkable use today. This is generally quoted as (equation); don’t worry if you don’t understand all the symbols in this! Of course, Newton could not have had this great insight if it wasn’t for the work of Kepler.

After Newton published his results, several experiments were performed to try and “weigh the Earth”, and determine the number G in Newton’s equation. More details…

This theory of gravity proved to be extremely successful, surviving all sorts of tests and remaining unchallenged for nearly 300 years. But, as with many scientific theories, more and more tests showed that it was not quite complete. For example, the orbit of Mercury did not quite fit with the Newtonian model, nor did observations in more extreme gravitational environments at the time…

This is where Albert Einstein comes into the picture. You may have heard of the “General Theory of Relativity” (which we will call GR from now on). This was the result of many years of Einstein’s work in the early 1900s, in collaboration with many others (such as Minkowski, Eddington…), and essentially provides a complete description of gravity. We won’t explore the details here, but will try to give an overview in a future blog post for those who are interested. We can safely say that the details of this are not required for the purposes of our experiment!

One key idea in GR is called the “equivalence principle”, which effectively states two things: 
The mass causing us to be pulled down to Earth is the same as the mass which makes it hard for us to suddenly move (think a car taking a bit of time to get moving)
The effect of gravity is the same as motion in what is called a non-inertial frame (imagine filming a car journey, where the camera should keep the car in the same view at all times. The view captured by the camera would be the non-inertial frame)
But the details of this are not too important. 

Naturally, it took a while for GR to be accepted by the scientific community, especially because it made some weird predictions like black holes and gravitational waves. Fast forward to today and these have both been detected many times! More details of how this has been made possible can be found (LIGO and EHT sites).
